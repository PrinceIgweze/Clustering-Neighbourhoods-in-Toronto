# Clustering-Neighbourhoods-in-Toronto

In this project I clustering Neighbourhoods in Toronto using K-means 

The first part of this project details building a dataframe of postal codes for each neighbourhoods along with borough and neighbourhood name using the Pandas python library


The second part details retrieval of longitutinal and latitudinal coordinates for each neighbourhood using the Geocoder python library, and retrieval of location data using the FourSquare API.


Geospatial data was visualized using the Folium python library, and K-means was used to cluster the neighbourhoods
